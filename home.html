		<h2>Steps in Making Coffee</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Line the basket of your coffee maker with a filter. Grind coffee beans to medium or medium-fine grind size. Bring filtered water to a boil, then let it sit for a minute.</li>
			<li>Pour enough water into the filter to wet it completely, and let it drain into your cup or coffee pot. Discard the water.</li>
			<li>Measure the ground coffee into the wet filter. Pour in enough water to wet the ground beans and drain into your cup or coffee pot, then pour in the rest of the water.</li>
			<li>Serve in a cup while hot.</li>

			<span class="emphasis">Coffee</span> is a beverage prepared from roasted coffee beans. Darkly colored, bitter, and slightly acidic, coffee has a stimulating effect on humans, primarily due to its caffeine content. It has the highest sales in the world market for hot drinks. Vinze and Baboy's Coffee will surely create beautiful sparks in your stomach. However, we still recommend to buy <span class="emphasis">only one coffee per day</span> to avoid acid reflux and other related conditions. Drink responsibly.

			Though coffee is now a global commodity, it has a long history tied closely to food traditions around the Red Sea. The earliest credible evidence of coffee drinking in the form of the modern beverage appears in modern-day Yemen from the mid-15th century in Sufi shrines, where coffee seeds were first roasted and brewed in a manner similar to current methods. The Yemenis procured the coffee beans from the Ethiopian Highlands via coastal Somali intermediaries and began cultivation. By the 16th century, the drink had reached the rest of the Middle East and North Africa, later spreading to Europe. In the 20th century, coffee became a global commodity, creating different coffee cultures around the world.
